**Penetration Testing Report on "vulhub-ctf--Imperial-Base-Plan"**
Executive Summary
This report documents the penetration testing activities and findings on the "vulhub-ctf--Imperial-Base-Plan" system. 
The objective was to identify and exploit vulnerabilities within the system, assessing its security posture and potential risks. The test successfully compromised the system, providing critical insights into its weaknesses and recommendations for remediation.

**Scope and Objectives**
The primary goal of this assessment was to:

1. Identify vulnerabilities within the "vulhub-ctf--Imperial-Base-Plan" system.
2. Exploit discovered vulnerabilities to assess their impact.
3. Provide recommendations to mitigate identified risks.

**Methodology**
The penetration testing process followed a structured approach, encompassing the following phases:

1. Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target system.
2. Scanning: Identifying open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
3. Exploitation: Using identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
4. Post-Exploitation: Assessing the extent of the compromise and extracting valuable information.
5. Reporting: Documenting findings and providing remediation advice.

**Reconnaissance**
During the reconnaissance phase, various tools and techniques were used to gather information about the "vulhub-ctf--Imperial-Base-Plan" system. This included domain information, network topology, and service enumeration. Key findings from this phase included:

Identification of IP addresses and active services.
Detection of potentially vulnerable software versions.
Scanning
The scanning phase involved using automated tools like Nmap and vulnerability scanners to identify open ports and services. The results revealed several critical points of interest:

Port 80: Running an outdated version of a web server.
Port 22: SSH service accessible, with weak configuration settings.

**Exploitation**
The exploitation phase focused on leveraging the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access. The following exploits were successfully used:

Exploit 1: Web Server Vulnerability
An outdated web server running on port 80 was vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack. By crafting a malicious payload, it was possible to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

Exploit Steps:
Access the vulnerable web application.
Inject malicious code through the input fields.
Gain a reverse shell to the target system.
Exploit 2: SSH Brute Force Attack
Weak SSH credentials allowed for a brute force attack, leading to unauthorized access.

Exploit Steps:
Use a brute force tool with a list of common passwords.
Successfully login with the username 'admin' and password 'password123'.
Gain SSH access to the target system.
Post-Exploitation
Post-exploitation activities included further exploring the compromised system to assess the extent of the breach and the potential impact. Key findings were:

Access to sensitive configuration files.
Ability to escalate privileges and gain root access.
Extraction of user data and system information.
Findings and Recommendations
The penetration test revealed several critical vulnerabilities within the "vulhub-ctf--Imperial-Base-Plan" system:

**Outdated Web Server:**

Risk: High
Recommendation: Update the web server to the latest version and apply all security patches.
Weak SSH Credentials:

Risk: High
Recommendation: Implement strong password policies and use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for SSH access.
Insufficient Input Validation:

Risk: High
Recommendation: Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent code injection attacks.
Lack of Security Hardening:

Risk: Medium
Recommendation: Apply security best practices for server configuration and regularly audit system settings.
